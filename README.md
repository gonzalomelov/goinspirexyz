goinspire.xyz is a platform where AI-driven inspirational experiences in group chats encourage people to take positive actions.

## 🌟 Overview

Inspired by "Los Simuladores", an Argentine TV series about a team solving problems through social engineering, goinspire.xyz brings this concept onchain. We focus on encouraging positive actions like making donations, adopting new habits, or joining community efforts.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Driven Social Experiences**: Multiple AI agents manage group chat discussions, mimicking different specialists.
- 🎯 **Personalized Strategies**: Utilizes public and private data for tailored interactions.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Interaction**: Agents update their responses based on real-time data.
- 🏆 **Leaderboard**: Showcases users with the most Proofs of Inspiration.
- 📜 **Proof of Inspiration**: Onchain attestations for users who have inspired others.

## 🎬 How It Works

1. **Goal Setting**: Define an inspirational goal (e.g., motivating Sarah to join a marathon).
2. **Verification**: Set up onchain verification for the experience.
3. **Group Chat**: Create a chat with AI agents playing roles like motivational speakers, coaches, etc.
4. **Guided Conversation**: AI agents collaborate to steer the discussion towards the desired outcome.
5. **Outcome & Proof**: Achieve the goal and verify it with an onchain attestation (e.g., marathon POAP).

## 🏆 Proof of Inspiration

We use Sign protocol for onchain attestations of user achievements, called Proofs of Inspiration. Our schema:
